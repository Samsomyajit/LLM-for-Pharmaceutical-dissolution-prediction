### SinkCondition
Based on the provided solubility data (0.15 mg/mL) and the rapid dissolution profile showing complete dissolution within 30 minutes, sink conditions are likely maintained for Glibenclamide. The high dissolution rate suggests adequate solubility relative to dose for sink conditions to prevail.

### Profile

| Time (min) | Dissolved (%) |
|------------|----------------|
| 0.00 | 0.00 |
| 5.00 | 35.00 |
| 10.00 | 75.00 |
| 15.00 | 92.00 |
| 30.00 | 100.00 |
| 60.00 | 100.00 |

### Recommendations
1. **Particle Size Optimization**: The 50.0 μm particle size appears appropriate given the rapid dissolution profile. Consider further micronization (2-10 μm) if enhanced dissolution kinetics are required for bioavailability.
2. **Formulation Strategy**: Employ solubility-enhancing techniques (amorphous solid dispersions, cyclodextrin complexes, or lipid-based formulations) to maintain sink conditions given the low solubility (0.15 mg/mL).
3. **Dissolution Method Development**: Use USP Apparatus II (paddles) at 50-75 rpm with appropriate surfactant-containing media (e.g., 0.5-1.0% SLS) to maintain sink conditions throughout testing.
4. **Quality Control**: Establish dissolution specifications at 30 minutes (Q=80%) based on the complete dissolution observed by this time point.
