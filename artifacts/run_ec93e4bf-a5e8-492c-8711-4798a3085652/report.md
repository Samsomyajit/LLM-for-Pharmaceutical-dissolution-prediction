### SinkCondition
Based on the provided dissolution profiles for Hydrochlorothiazide and Glibenclamide, all profiles demonstrate rapid and complete dissolution (reaching 100% or near-complete release), indicating that sink conditions are likely maintained throughout the experiments. The absence of solubility data (0.0 mg/mL) suggests these are likely idealized or modeled profiles rather than experimental measurements with actual solubility constraints.

### Profile
| Time (min) | Dissolved (%) |
|------------|----------------|
| 0.00 | 0.00 |
| 5.00 | 35.00 |
| 10.00 | 75.00 |
| 15.00 | 92.00 |
| 30.00 | 100.00 |
| 60.00 | 100.00 |

### Recommendations
1. **Experimental Validation**: The provided profiles show idealized behavior with 0.0 μm particle size and 0.0 mg/mL solubility, which are not physiologically realistic. Conduct actual dissolution testing with appropriate particle size distribution and media composition to obtain clinically relevant data.

2. **Media Selection**: Use dissolution media that maintain sink conditions throughout the experiment (typically requiring volume ≥3× the saturation volume). For Hydrochlorothiazide (BCS Class III), consider pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 buffers. For Glibenclamide (BCS Class II), include surfactants (e.g., 0.5-1% SLS) to ensure sink conditions.

3. **Particle Size Control**: Actual formulations should have controlled particle size distributions rather than 0.0 μm. For Hydrochlorothiazide, target D90 <50 μm; for Glibenclamide, consider micronization to improve dissolution.

4. **Model Fitting**: Apply appropriate dissolution models (e.g., first-order, Weibull, or Higuchi models) to characterize release kinetics once real experimental data is obtained.

5. **Quality Control**: Establish dissolution specifications based on the fastest and slowest profiles observed (e.g., Q=80% in 30 minutes for Hydrochlorothiazide, Q=80% in 45 minutes for Glibenclamide).
