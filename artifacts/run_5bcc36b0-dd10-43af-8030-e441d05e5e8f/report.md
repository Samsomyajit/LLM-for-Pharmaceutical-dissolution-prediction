### SinkCondition
Based on the provided solubility data (0.3260 mg/mL mean across drugs) and dissolution profiles showing complete dissolution (100%) within 30 minutes for multiple compounds, sink conditions are likely maintained. The rapid and complete dissolution profiles, particularly for Hydrochlorothiazide with its higher solubility (0.45 mg/mL), suggest adequate sink conditions where drug concentration in the dissolution medium remains well below saturation.

### Profile
| Time (min) | Dissolved (%) |
|------------|----------------|
| 0.00 | 0.00 |
| 5.00 | 35.00 |
| 10.00 | 75.00 |
| 15.00 | 92.00 |
| 30.00 | 100.00 |
| 60.00 | 100.00 |

### Recommendations
1. **Verify Sink Conditions**: Confirm that the dissolution medium volume and composition maintain sink conditions throughout the experiment, especially given the relatively low solubility (0.3260 mg/mL mean).

2. **Particle Size Optimization**: The profile shows rapid dissolution (100% by 30 min). Consider evaluating smaller particle sizes (e.g., 2-10 μm range as seen with Cilostazol) if even faster onset is desired, though the current performance appears adequate.

3. **Formulation Development**: Since complete dissolution is achieved within 30 minutes, focus formulation efforts on stability, bioavailability, and manufacturing consistency rather than dissolution enhancement.

4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare with the Hydrochlorothiazide profiles (45 μm, cuboid) which show similar rapid dissolution patterns, suggesting the current shape and size parameters are effective.

5. **Extended Testing**: Include additional time points between 0-5 minutes and 15-30 minutes to better characterize the initial dissolution rate and plateau phase.
