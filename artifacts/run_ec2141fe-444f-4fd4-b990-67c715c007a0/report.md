### SinkCondition
Based on the provided data, sink conditions are likely maintained for all drugs except possibly Cilostazol. Glibenclamide (solubility 0.15 mg/mL) and Hydrochlorothiazide (solubility 0.45 mg/mL) show rapid and complete dissolution (>90% within 30 min), indicating adequate sink conditions. Cilostazol has extremely low solubility (0.00626 mg/mL), which may approach non-sink conditions despite its small particle size (2.4 μm), as evidenced by its slower dissolution rate (only 90% at 40 min).

### Recommendations
1. **Verify sink conditions**: For Cilostazol, consider increasing media volume or adding surfactants to ensure sink conditions, as its low solubility may limit dissolution rate.
2. **Particle size optimization**: The data shows smaller particles (e.g., Cilostazol 2.4 μm) dissolve faster than larger ones (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide 200 μm). For poorly soluble drugs, reduce particle size to enhance dissolution.
3. **Formulation strategies**: For drugs with solubility challenges (like Cilostazol), explore amorphous solid dispersions, lipid-based formulations, or co-crystals to improve solubility and dissolution.
4. **Dissolution method development**: Use biorelevant media (e.g., FaSSIF/FeSSIF) to better predict in vivo performance, especially for low-solubility compounds.
5. **Model fitting**: Apply mathematical models (e.g., Higuchi, Weibull) to quantify dissolution kinetics and identify rate-limiting steps for each drug.
