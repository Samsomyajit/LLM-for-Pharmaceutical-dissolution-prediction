### SinkCondition
Based on the provided solubility data (0.3260 mg/mL mean across cilostazol, glibenclamide, and hydrochlorothiazide) and typical dissolution media volumes (500-900 mL), the condition is likely sink. The mean solubility corresponds to a dose solubility of approximately 3.26 mg in 10 mL, which for typical drug doses (e.g., 5-100 mg) would require media volumes >15 mL to maintain sink, easily satisfied by standard apparatus.

### Recommendations
1. **Experimental Validation**: Conduct actual dissolution testing using USP Apparatus I (baskets) or II (paddles) at 50-75 rpm in 500-900 mL of appropriate media (e.g., pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) to confirm this predicted profile.

2. **Particle Size Optimization**: Given the significant impact of particle size observed in the hydrochlorothiazide profiles (45 μm vs 200 μm), consider micronization to <50 μm if faster dissolution is required, but assess flow and compaction properties.

3. **Formulation Development**: Incorporate surfactants (e.g., 0.1-0.5% SLS) or cyclodextrins if the API shows poor wetting or solubility-limited dissolution, though sink condition appears adequate here.

4. **Discrimination Power**: Ensure the method can distinguish between formulations; include time points at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes for adequate profile characterization.

5. **Sink Verification**: Confirm sink condition by ensuring media volume provides at least 3-5x the saturation solubility of the dose; for a 50 mg dose and ~0.33 mg/mL solubility, ≥500 mL is appropriate.
