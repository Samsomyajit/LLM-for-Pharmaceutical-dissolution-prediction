### SinkCondition
Sink condition is maintained throughout dissolution, as the drug concentration (10.0 mg/mL solubility) is significantly higher than typical sink condition requirements (typically ≤15-20% of solubility). The high solubility relative to dose and rapid dissolution rate ensure sink conditions prevail.

### Recommendations
1. **Dissolution Method**: Use a USP Apparatus II (paddle) at 50-75 rpm with 900 mL of dissolution medium (pH 6.8 phosphate buffer recommended) to maintain sink conditions
2. **Sampling Points**: Include early time points (0.5, 1, 2 min) to capture the rapid dissolution profile
3. **Analytical Method**: Employ UV spectrophotometry with appropriate wavelength selection for this highly soluble compound
4. **Shape Consideration**: The ellipsoidal shape may contribute to slightly faster dissolution compared to cuboid particles of equivalent size
5. **Validation**: Confirm complete dissolution within 5 minutes to ensure batch consistency
6. **Particle Size Control**: Maintain tight control over the sub-micron particle size (0.54 μm) as it is critical for the observed rapid dissolution behavior
