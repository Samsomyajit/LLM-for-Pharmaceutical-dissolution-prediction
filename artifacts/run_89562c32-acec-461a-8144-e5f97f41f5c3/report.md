### SinkCondition
Based on the provided solubility data (0.3260 mg/mL mean) and the dissolution profiles of similar drugs (Glibenclamide, Hydrochlorothiazide, Cilostazol), the dissolution conditions likely maintain sink conditions. The rapid dissolution rates observed (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide reaching >80% in <10 min) and high percent dissolved values support that the volume and hydrodynamics are sufficient to prevent solubility-limited dissolution for this compound.

### Recommendations
1. **Experimental Verification**: Conduct actual dissolution testing using USP Apparatus I (basket) or II (paddle) with appropriate medium (e.g., pH 6.8 phosphate buffer) to validate this predicted profile.
2. **Particle Size Optimization**: Given the significant impact of particle size observed in the reference data (e.g., Hydrochlorothiazide 45Î¼m vs 200Î¼m), consider micronization if faster dissolution is required.
3. **Formulation Considerations**: Incorporate appropriate disintegrants and surfactants to ensure complete wetting and maintain sink conditions throughout the dissolution process.
4. **QC Specifications**: Set dissolution specifications at 15 min (Q=80%) and 30 min (Q=85%) based on the predicted profile to ensure batch consistency.
5. **Biorelevance Assessment**: Evaluate whether this dissolution rate aligns with the desired in vivo performance based on the drug's absorption window.
